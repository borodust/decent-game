# General Premise

The general premise is a player picking a cyborg or alien evolution path, battling aliens on cyborgs on his journey to confront The Leader.
The world is ravaged by total war, with aliens and cyborgs fighting each other (optional), the player, npcs (optional).

When the player arrives to The Leader, the before that "insane" leader informs the Player that he is one of many prototypes tricked into coming to 
the base to be the ultimate weapon. The Leader offers the player to join or die and informs that if The Leader loses the fight, the leader plans to hit 
the [Self-Destruct Button]. The player defeats The Leader and decides whether to activate the self-destruct. Text prompts based on user actions throughout game:

1 - picked alien or cyborg

2 - helped npcs from enemy swarms or walked by

3 - decides to hit the self-destruct button or not

Affect the ending text information. 

# NPCs - questions

save NPCs from enemies or walk by. recorded as karma. 
an NPC to allow the player to upgrade himself by using collected robo or alien parts
npc element can give a bonus weapon, npc can give some unique stuff though if you talk right to them or smth
tip about which weapon is effective against upcoming enemy

# Aliens

first in game, alien is thought to be alien. Then the big AHA moment is that the alien tech is actually human biotech/nanotech technology gone out of control
like the chinese virus.

# Planned Enemies

Currently as it stand we would have two different enemy types. a flying stinger and a melee one. 4 total. the boss and maybe a miniboss are extra.

# Necessary Environment

Outside of a [Self-Destruct button], visual and stage elements are optional. From the wrighters perspective, the world can have a dream aspect of darkness and minimal elements, with resources gone to monster / enemies / NPCS designs.

Request - Graphics Design should follow up with writer as to what major stage changes, enemy progressions or environmental interaction / NPC animations etc are going to be implemented, so that the script can be modified accordingly.

# Minimal information elements for storytelling aspects

* Full-screen cut-screens (FS-CS) with in-code editable text and insertable image 
These will be used for informing the player and for end credits.

Reference Screen from Strider, animations optional:

*Scenes / Story points where FS-CS will be used, mandatory

- 1 Information to player at start of game
- 2 Prompt to pick alien or cyborg gear

- 3 Minimal 3 taunts from Final Boss throughout the game, as game progresses / can be OSD

- 4 Boss monologue before final battle
- 5 Option to activate [Self-Destruct Button]

- 6 Information to player about final outcome, based on player choices

- 7 Final Credits

# Optional Storytelling

-On-Screen Display (OSD) [like in shovel knight, icon and text box on top]

for showing info, boss taunts, npc messages


# Design requests  - non-mandatory

As many small details that promote user connection to the game


* Living Environment

machine lights go on or off ass player goes by
when hostages are freed, graffiti appear on walls - "We live" "They don't live" "We SHALL have cake"

* Responce to player actions 

alien growth responds to player going by
dead enemy units have agony reach out for player going by

# Music

my emotional vision for the audio is based on the game premise as i see it - nightmare like state, as when you play too many games and continue in your sleep. it's pixelated and chiptuny, but has this larger atmospheric REAL feel to it - wider scope, reverb, switch to silence, etc.
and if we break to silence or just pure atomospherics without lead keyboard or drums, it breaks the game-like aspect, promoting a WTF feeling of disorientation


- minimal option would be intro track - game track - ending track. sound effects on top.

More interaction with game welcome (like tie-in music to status changes, stage changes, boss arrival, etc)
