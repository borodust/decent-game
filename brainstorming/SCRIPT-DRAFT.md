# Script Notes and Rough Draft

The general premise is a player picking a cyborg or alien evolution path, battling aliens on cyborgs on his journey to confront The Leader.
The world is ravaged by total war, with aliens and cyborgs fighting each other (optional), the player, npcs (optional).
When the player arrives to The Leader, the before that "insane" leader informs the Player that he is one of many prototypes tricked into coming to 
the base to be the ultimate weapon. The Leader offers the player to join or die and informs that if The Leader loses the fight, the leader plans to hit 
the [Self-Destruct Button]. The player defeats The Leader and decides whether to activate the self-destruct. Text prompts based on user actions throughout game

1 - picked alien or cyborg
2 - helped npcs from enemy swarms or walked by
3 - decides to hit the self-destruct button or not

Affect the ending text information.
