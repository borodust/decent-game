# Script Proposal

# Script in brief

You start off with nothing, battling progressing monsters towards a final fight. You pick alien or cyborg gear and progress through tougher abilities vs tougher monsters.

After the Big Boss fight, you have a choice to make - hit the self-destruct, destroying the Evil System, or run for it? The boss is dead.


The final ending (via text and flat graphics ) is affected by whether you helped others, if you used Alien or Cyborg gear, and how you handle the self-destruct.

# Quick Sketches

* Final ending texts, choices impact. 

* Player Alien, No Self Destruct. 

Alien glyphs flash. You can read them now. "You are now one of us. Life eternal, life united. Life is the choice."
This makes sense. Mom? But you don't remember Your mother's face anymore. You hear the machines around you stop.

Alien tentacles spread through world

* Player Cyborg, No Self Destruct.

By allways concentrating on Victory and Power, you have become a machine. As you are consumed by The Leader's Network, You think: "I gave up my freedom, my humanity for power". There is a flash.
You feel yourself engulfed in a vast network of moving machinery.

Then there is only the machine. 

* Alien or Cyborg, hit self-destruct, no help to npcs

You made the hard choice. You sacrificed yourself and others. Now, it must be finished. You hit the button. In a few seconds, both the alien network and The Leader's machines will be destroyed. Both are a threat. Humanity is finished. You know this now. There is a flash.


*Helped NPCs, hit self-destruct

You hit the button, yet nothing happens. "Wait, Hero!" You hear one the people you helped scream. "We have found another way. You don't have to die! You've done Your part, now let us help!". As you faint from your wounds, you feel caring hands embrace You and carry You away from The Facility. "We stayed human through it all",  You think, as you finally let yourself sleep.


# Final Boss Interaction - discuss

Boss proposal - fundamentalist cyborg that spews a mixture of all power ideas throughout the ages. Think Handsom Jack from Borderlands 2 with Stalin, Hillary and Trump and Hitler. 

? Do as full-screen prompts between gameplay or partial on-screen display with text? OSD would give cheap interaction with NPCs as well.

Sample Quotes (needs more humor):

"Only a Free Market Will Bring along the Final Reich, Comrades!"

"We need leibensraum for our non-gendered aryan tovarisches!"

"My pronouns are: "Fuhrer, Your Prophet!"

"I'm sending you the bill for freedom, by drone delivery! Freedom isn't free!"

"The triumph of will over power comes with security of no choice!"

"You have the choice to join us or the choice to die!"

"You're on the wrong side of history but the right side of our non-violent guns!"

"Resistance to voluntary freedom is an act of initiating agression!"

# Core Ideas to discuss

Features must be cheap to produce, concentrate on player involvement and connection to game. 

* choice based skill progression system, with consequences 

Make the player feel at least slightly attached to the characters in the game, as well as offering a degree of freedom of progression. i.e. Pick cyborg skill tree - loose humanity. 

* rewards for paying attention to details

* persistent karma despite save/reload

* NPC interaction 
Can be minimal, like boss taunt screens in Strider 
Add OSD taunts or NPC on screen display messages
Interaction with computers or NPCs in game
Like saving an npc against enemy swarm or running by. 


Minimal features

Boss text taunts throughout game
Different endings based on core game choices 


#Philosophy

# Mythical Journey - 3 plot structure - Transformation
You were the monster and the savior all along - return to home
but nothing is the same.

# Game Mechanics As Profound truth. 

Mini S.P.E.C.I.A.L, or Fallout, but with mechanics.

Players loved Fallout for the ability to specialize characters, affecting gameplay, and affecting world destiny by in-game choices.

This is a platformer, not a strategy or RPG, but even basic ideas can promote player connection and interest in  a game.

HIDDEN INFORMATION 

A text dialogue that players usually skip can contain vital information as to what weapon the upcoming monsters are most damaged by. 

This could be a "tricky" choice dialogue or getting information from a "computer system" that requires interaction in opposite to the platform shooter style.

 If you don't get the information,skipping the dialogues, the game is harder as the player gets more damage or delivers less damage.
But still doable by sheer motor skill

HIDDEN DAMAGE

A virus or a sniping enemy that delivers damage over time.
Can be avoided due to moral choices, text reading or mechanical skill.


# Concept 1 - The Hero's Journey ( Most complex) 

Execution cost / complexity - NPCs, Lots of text, Ability change, Life / Ability meters, Ability progression, Karma 

Descent - Ascent - Rebirth

The player, a cybernetic super-human descends, going lower, into a an antarctic facility containing The Final Solution - a super-weapon that is about to bring the fall of the Free World 
(Enemy - Nazis, NGO, Illuminati Renegade Communist Party - discuss)

On fighting the percieved final boss, happy music, player going to exit, the doors slam and the Villain proclaims that the player was The Final Component all along, that his cybernetic system is linked up to The Final Solution and in [runtime to get to finish minus some amount] the world will get destroyed. 

The players abilities are going down, with a life meter progressing down, or a progression bar lowering (think draining mana or life-force). The power / level-ups of the player are reversing.

The player has A CHOICE of hitting the console self-destruct and destroying the facilty and himself.

If yes, finals show a chain reaction destroying the world if the player did not help NPCs along the way. 

If he helped, brief shot of NPCs jamming key system components and the Final Solution sputtering without delivering the final blow. 

If player decides to self-destruct his cybernetic system alone, he loses some abilities but a Support messages him that he has a new ability (super-jump or the like, or super-power-up of one weapon but loss of ability on others).

Otherwise, the super-ability is available but not to a great extent (slightly higher jump or similair)

if player did not hit the self-destruct button, he has to ASCEND, going in reverse but this time UP stairs, passages, etc. 
he has a propulsion system or higher jump that was not available (affected by choices above).

The monsters/ enemies from before now have extra damage  / abilities, come in bigger swarms. If player stays at area too long, facility walls collaps and enemies swarm. Player feeling of despair rises. Respawns work but the timer is on and going down.

TODO - discuss finale ( enemies at home? ) whether complexity is too great. 

# CONCEPT 2 - Super Mario Punk

This does not go outside of platformer kitsch, concentrating on solid game mechanics, fun gameplay and over the top cynical meme commentary (Think "All Your Base are belong to us" turned up to 11)

What has to be discussed is The Power-Up - ability that is time or resource limited and reverses the frustration of existing enemy superiority.

Mario can't kill Turtles except jumping on them, but FireFlower gives that satisfying ability.

Does the power-up come from skillful high-point execution, level exploration, NPC interaction or multiple replays?

This one requires group discussion and review of existing outstanding power-up examples


# CONCEPT 3 - TRIBUTE 

SuperStritderShatterContra

"Why you not happy with 2d cuberpunk, you punk?"

Pensioner Mutant Ninja Communists of Lenin, Engels, Marx and Kautsky, quoting revolutionary terror and Das Kapital not enough for You? Soviet and Yankee zombies running at you with "Freedom isn't free!" and "Communism means Free healthcare for all"

Nothing wrong with a commando going up against progressing enemies with improving weapons. Die, lose power-up.

Think of spreader in super-contra that sure made a lot of things easier.

From a script stand-point, this is the easiest - sketch out the levels and think what text would be funny and appropriate.
Can be largely determined by art and led by art directions.


TODO script and storyline

Decide on what is doable, make a file with 

# Level break-down 

* Jungle

Weapon: Sword
Enemies: Human, range, melee
Boss: Strong human
Dialogue idea: Enemy discovery, WTF are they doing here? 
(plot discovery)
Power-up: Life, Sword power-up
Flawless power-up (Help innocents): 10% higher life

* Base 1 

Weapon: Sword, First Gun
Enemies: Human, range, Turrets
Boss: Mechanical, human operated
Dialogue idea: Plot thickens (this is worse than we thought!)
Power-up: Life, Second Gun

etc
