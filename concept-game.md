# Script Proposal

Scroll down for actual proposals. 

#Philosophy

# Mythical Journey - 3 plot structure - Transformation
You were the monster and the savior all along - return to home
but nothing is the same.

# Game Mechanics As Profound truth. 

Mini S.P.E.C.I.A.L, or Fallout, but with mechanics.

Players loved Fallout for the ability to specialize characters, affecting gameplay, and affecting world destiny by in-game choices.

This is a platformer, not a strategy or RPG, but even basic ideas can promote player connection and interest in  a game.

HIDDEN INFORMATION 

A text dialogue that players usually skip can contain vital information as to what weapon the upcoming monsters are most damaged by. 

This could be a "tricky" choice dialogue or getting information from a "computer system" that requires interaction in opposite to the platform shooter style.

 If you don't get the information,skipping the dialogues, the game is harder as the player gets more damage or delivers less damage.
But still doable by sheer motor skill

HIDDEN DAMAGE

A virus or a sniping enemy that delivers damage over time.
Can be avoided due to moral choices, text reading or mechanical skill.


# Concept 1 - The Hero's Journey ( Most complex) 

Execution cost / complexity - NPCs, Lots of text, Ability change, Life / Ability meters, Ability progression, Karma 

Descent - Ascent - Rebirth

The player, a cybernetic super-human descends, going lower, into a an antarctic facility containing The Final Solution - a super-weapon that is about to bring the fall of the Free World 
(Enemy - Nazis, NGO, Illuminati Renegade Communist Party - discuss)

On fighting the percieved final boss, happy music, player going to exit, the doors slam and the Villain proclaims that the player was The Final Component all along, that his cybernetic system is linked up to The Final Solution and in [runtime to get to finish minus some amount] the world will get destroyed. 

The players abilities are going down, with a life meter progressing down, or a progression bar lowering (think draining mana or life-force). The power / level-ups of the player are reversing.

The player has A CHOICE of hitting the console self-destruct and destroying the facilty and himself.

If yes, finals show a chain reaction destroying the world if the player did not help NPCs along the way. 

If he helped, brief shot of NPCs jamming key system components and the Final Solution sputtering without delivering the final blow. 

If player decides to self-destruct his cybernetic system alone, he loses some abilities but a Support messages him that he has a new ability (super-jump or the like, or super-power-up of one weapon but loss of ability on others).

Otherwise, the super-ability is available but not to a great extent (slightly higher jump or similair)

if player did not hit the self-destruct button, he has to ASCEND, going in reverse but this time UP stairs, passages, etc. 
he has a propulsion system or higher jump that was not available (affected by choices above).

The monsters/ enemies from before now have extra damage  / abilities, come in bigger swarms. If player stays at area too long, facility walls collaps and enemies swarm. Player feeling of despair rises. Respawns work but the timer is on and going down.

TODO - discuss finale ( enemies at home? ) whether complexity is too great. 

# CONCEPT 2 - Super Mario Punk

This does not go outside of platformer kitsch, concentrating on solid game mechanics, fun gameplay and over the top cynical meme commentary (Think "All Your Base are belong to us" turned up to 11)

What has to be discussed is The Power-Up - ability that is time or resource limited and reverses the frustration of existing enemy superiority.

Mario can't kill Turtles except jumping on them, but FireFlower gives that satisfying ability.

Does the power-up come from skillful high-point execution, level exploration, NPC interaction or multiple replays?

This one requires group discussion and review of existing outstanding power-up examples


# CONCEPT 3 - TRIBUTE 

SuperStritderShatterContra

"Why you not happy with 2d cuberpunk, you punk?"

Pensioner Mutant Ninja Communists of Lenin, Engels, Marx and Kautsky, quoting revolutionary terror and Das Kapital not enough for You? Soviet and Yankee zombies running at you with "Freedom isn't free!" and "Communism means Free healthcare for all"

Nothing wrong with a commando going up against progressing enemies with improving weapons. Die, lose power-up.

Think of spreader in super-contra that sure made a lot of things easier.

From a script stand-point, this is the easiest - sketch out the levels and think what text would be funny and appropriate.
Can be largely determined by art and led by art directions.


TODO script and storyline

Decide on what is doable, make a file with 

# Level break-down 

=========== Jungle ===============
Weapon: Sword
Enemies: Human, range, melee
Boss: Strong human
Dialogue idea: Enemy discovery, WTF are they doing here? 
(plot discovery)
Power-up: Life, Sword power-up
Flawless power-up (Help innocents): 10% higher life

=========== Base 1 ===============
Weapon: Sword, First Gun
Enemies: Human, range, Turrets
Boss: Mechanical, human operated
Dialogue idea: Plot thickens (this is worse than we thought!)
Power-up: Life, Second Gun
New Ability: CyborgSuit, Invincibility or Support 

etc
